Be the spiritual mother or father of this child. Welcome it with your affection and love through a brief daily prayer for 9 months.",
    "intro_p2": "One of the benefits of Spiritual Adoption is the happy conviction that a human being, desired by God and sent to this world to fulfill their mission, is being saved. Thus, spiritual mothers and fathers feel the happiness of giving their free love to a child and its mother and feel perfectly aligned with God, the source of all life.",

      "p1": "At the base of our Christian life we have the commandment of love. In it God is reminding us that we cannot be indifferent towards our neighbor. In today's world, our most vulnerable brothers are the unborn, threatened by abortion, as they cannot defend themselves alone. It is our mission to save them from this threat.",
      "p2": "Most of the time abortion is presented as a totally safe procedure that does not harm the woman's health. The real dangers of performing abortion and the existence of post-abortion syndrome are hidden. For love of women, we need to make them aware and offer them the necessary support so they never choose abortion as a solution in the case of an unwanted pregnancy.",
      "p3": "Through Spiritual Adoption, we can effectively protect the child and help its mother."
    },
    "child_gesture": {
      "title": "Gesture of love for the child",
      "p1": "Spiritual Adoption, first of all, defends the life of the child, threatened by abortion. The tradition of the Catholic Church has always considered human life as something that must be protected and favored in all stages of its existence. Honest science, which takes into account known scientific data and simple logic, recognizes conception as the beginning of a new life, the beginning of the existence of a new human being that has its own organism distinct from the father's and mother's organism, even if during the first 9 months it depends totally on the latter.",
      "p2": "Defending an unborn child we are proving our love to it and to God who is the source of life. No matter how many times a new life arises without the intention of the parents, for God there is no error - each person is loved by Him, desired and enriched with gifts and talents to fulfill an important mission in this world.",
      "p3": "In the proposal of Spiritual Adoption, we are invited to care for a child threatened by abortion in the first 9 months after their conception. We believe that God, in His mercy and omnipotence, will help this child survive this most difficult moment, be welcomed and loved by their own family or by an adoptive family.",
      "p4": "On the other hand, we know that intentionally taking the life of any person, especially an unborn child, is an unacceptable and unnecessary act. As much as the child's mother may not have the conditions to guarantee the future of her child, there are many initiatives that aim to help the mother during pregnancy and there are also many families who dream of adopting a child and giving them a home and much love."
    },
    "mother_gesture": {
      "title": "Gesture of love for the mother",
      "p1": "The prayer of Spiritual Adoption not only protects the life of the child facing the threat of abortion, but also protects the child's mother from the various consequences that may arise after the procedure. Abortion advocates often portray it as a safe and risk-free procedure when performed with proper medical assistance. However, this is far from true. Medicine recognizes several physical and psychological complications associated with abortion. According to Dr. Maurício Price, the serious consequences of abortion are always present, whether performed legally or clandestinely.",
      "p2": "Furthermore, it is important to highlight that in research involving women who faced complications after abortion:",
      "bullet1": "More than 90% reported that they did not receive adequate information to make an informed decision.",
      "bullet2": "More than 80% stated that they probably would not have opted for abortion if they had not been strongly encouraged by third parties, including abortion counselors.",
      "bullet3": "83% mentioned that they would have decided to carry the pregnancy forward if they had received support from their partners, families, or other significant people in their lives."
    },
    "physical_consequences": {
      "title": "Physical consequences:",
      "text": "Medical scientists point to the following complications: cervical laceration, which can result in subsequent premature births; uterine perforation; risk of infertility; danger of damage to the intestines, tubes and bladder; removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) and/or the endometrium (mucosa); ectopic pregnancy; introduction of saline solution into the mother's bloodstream; and maternal death, regardless of the abortion method."
    },
    "psychological_consequences": {
      "title": "Psychological consequences:",
      "p1": "Psychologists and psychiatrists point to the following disorders as the most frequent: flashbacks of the moment of abortion; hysterical crises; feelings of guilt; visions or dreams with the aborted child; difficulty in maintaining and developing interpersonal relationships; anxiety and fear of another pregnancy; drop in self-esteem due to the destruction of one's own child; depression; and nine times more propensity to suicide.",
      "p2": "Studies show that women who abort have a set of psychological symptoms that occur much more frequently than among women who do not. These symptoms include flashbacks (63%), suicide attempts (28%), hysterical attacks (51%), loss of self-confidence and self-esteem (82%), eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia (39%), illegal drug use (41%) and loss of pleasure during sexual intercourse (59%).",
      "p3": "Abortion is related to increased depression, violent behavior, alcohol and drug abuse, replacement pregnancy and reduced maternal bonding with children born later. These factors are closely associated with child abuse and seem to confirm individual clinical assessment linking post-traumatic abortion with mistreatment.",
      "p4": "A study with 1,000 women, to discover the differences between female adolescents who had given birth and those who had practiced abortion in the face of an unexpected pregnancy, found that adolescents who proceeded to abortion expressed five times more need for psychological help than those who had their children. The researcher states that 'being a mother in adolescence is inevitably an experience that implies difficulties, but the occurrence of psychological problems with the practice of abortion is much higher than with carrying the pregnancy forward'."
    },
    "spiritual_consequences": {
      "title": "Spiritual consequences:",
      "p1": "The Catholic Church clearly addresses, in several documents, the value of human life from conception to natural death. It highlights the need to protect it and emphasizes the gravity of the act of abortion, both for the women who practice it and for those who collaborate with such practices.",
      "p2": "This perspective finds its basis in the fifth commandment of God, which warns us against any action, word, thought or omission that results in the loss of the life of another human being. According to this view, whoever kills or collaborates with the death of their neighbor is in opposition to God, who is the source of life, not death. Thus, beyond the evil committed against the other, the aggressor or collaborator of this aggression harms themselves and their own history.",
      "p3": "The injustice of murder is recognized not only by those who believe, but by every human being who preserves mental health and does not let themselves be seduced by inhuman ideologies. Hence the reason why most countries include the right to life as fundamental and inalienable in their constitutions.",
      "p4": "The person who practices or collaborates with abortion seriously compromises their relationship with God and their neighbor. This entails serious spiritual consequences, going beyond the temporal dimension. Therefore, by defending the life of the unborn, we are not only protecting the child threatened by abortion, but also their mother and all other people involved, from the spiritual implications of this act.",

        "quote2": "'The fruit of human generation, from the first moment of its existence, that is, from the moment the zygote has been formed, demands the unconditional respect that is morally due to the human being in his bodily and spiritual totality. The human being is to be respected and treated as a person from the moment of conception; and therefore from that same moment his rights as a person must be recognized, among which in the first place is the inviolable right of every innocent human being to life.'

        "p2272": "2272. Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life. 'A person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae' (Canon Law 1398), by the very commission of the offense and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law. The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy. Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the whole of society."

The tragedy that befell the Ulma family and the Jews hidden in their home became a symbol of courage and solidarity amidst the brutality of the Nazi occupation. The example of compassion and altruism demonstrated by the Ulmas remains as a testimony of the silent resistance of ordinary people in the face of terror and injustice.",
      "p3": "In 1942, the Nazis deported several Jewish families from Markowa to concentration camps as part of their anti-Semitic policy. Only those who were hidden in peasant houses survived the persecution. On the Ulma couple's farm, eight Jews found shelter: Saul Godman, a cattle dealer, and his four sons, known as Szall. Also sisters Golda Grünfeld and Layka Didner, with a daughter.",

      "p10": "The Ulma family is liturgically commemorated on July 7, since it's the date of the marriage of Józef and Wiktoria."
