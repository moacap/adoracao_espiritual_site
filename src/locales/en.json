      "subtitle1": "The tragedy behind the truth",
      "p8": "After a long time struggling with bureaucratic hurdles, she discovered a truth that hid many secrets:",
      "p9": "“I discovered I had survived an abortion, but the story got complicated and as I investigated, I came across the harsh reality,” says Melissa.",
      "p10": "In fact, Melissa's biological mother had been forced to abort. The most surprising part of this story is knowing who forced her and committed this crime: Melissa's grandmother, a “nurse” who worked at a place that performed abortions and didn't hesitate to organize everything to kill her own granddaughter before birth, in the eighth month of pregnancy.",
      "p11": "Her grandmother's cruelty knew no bounds. Upon discovering the baby had survived the abortion, she left her in a room to die alone. It was the kindness of another nurse that saved her. Without the grandmother noticing, she called an ambulance to transfer the newborn to a hospital.",
      "subtitle2": "A deceived and tormented mother",
      "p12": "But there was a second secret in this story, Melissa's biological mother didn't know her daughter had survived the abortion. She was told she had died and for all those years had lived tormented by having killed her baby.",
      "p13": "When Melissa learned the terrible story of her birth, she experienced a struggle within herself. “I didn't want to tell anyone, I was ashamed and at the same time angry, I lived desolate for years because of it. But I realized that if I didn't tell, my biological mother would never know I was alive,” she tells Fox News.",
      "p14": "It took several years to experience true forgiveness. Thanks to her Christian faith she managed to overcome the trauma of her birth, even managing to get in touch with her biological mother.",
      "p15": "“Now I know my grandmother wanted to change my destiny so I wouldn't be in the world. For some reason, my birth and adoption were a secret to everyone. But I can't keep this secret anymore. I want to tell my story to help save millions of babies who are aborted every year. I want to help mothers make the decision to bet on their children's lives,” continues Melissa.",
      "p16": "Abortion is a human rights issue, which is why this survivor is part of the pro-life movement in the United States.",
      "p17": "“I once read a statistic that said every abortion affects seven people, not just the mother, but the father, grandparents, siblings... If 58 million abortions were performed in the last 44 years, that equals at least 406 million people who suffered the consequences of an abortion”.",
      "p18": "Thus, Melissa launched a message of encouragement to the pro-life community that is being persecuted. “To people who mock and ridicule human life I can only show love, we can love people, but not share their way of thinking, even if they don't believe life has unique value,” she states.",
      "p19": "Melissa also criticized Planned Parenthood, the leading abortion provider in the United States. “I am sure if they had taken my mother to abort at the Planned Parenthood center I wouldn't have survived: there is no mercy there. And even if I had survived the abortion, they would do everything so I wouldn't be alive,” she sentences.",
      "p20": "Now, Melissa Ohden is the author of several books in which she speaks about forgiveness and the meaning of life. In addition, she created the website “The Abortion Survivors”, a community so that people who survived an abortion can find psychological and social help.",
      "p21": "In her personal life, Melissa formed her own family. She is the mother of two daughters and the eldest, Olivia, was born in the same hospital where she was cared for after surviving the abortion."

      "p1": "Vietnamese Tong Phuoc Phuc is another wonderful example of real-life heroes! If it weren't for him, over a hundred children would have been aborted in his country. Yes, he is the father of dozens of children who might never have been born.",
      "p2": "This love story began in 2001, when Phuc's wife was pregnant and had many complications. During the delivery, which was extremely difficult, Phuc saw that many of the women entering the nearby room left there without their babies.",
      "p3": "He didn't really understand why at first. Only later did Phuc realize the children had been aborted, upon seeing doctors throwing fetuses in the trash. Phuc was moved by what he saw and asked to take the bodies home.",
      "p4": "With a humble life, he gathered all his savings from his work as a builder to buy a field where he could bury the remains of the babies that were thrown in the trash. Phuc's wife found it all very strange at first, to the point of thinking her husband had gone mad. Even so, he continued and today, over 10,000 fetuses rest in peace in the field bought by him.",
      "p5": "Since then, mothers who aborted children visit the cemetery to pray for their children. In addition, pregnant women at risk of abortion began to seek Phuc for help. He then opened the doors of his home to receive them and offered to adopt the babies they couldn't raise.",

      "p7": "The boys adopted by him are named <strong>Vihn</strong> (meaning “Honor”), and the girls are named <strong>Tam</strong> (meaning “Heart”). The second name is always the mother's or her city of origin - in case the mother returns to pick her up.",
      "p8": "The surname is Phuc himself, as he considers everyone as if they were his children. Phuc says “these children now have a safe home. I am willing to help and teach them to be good people”.",
      "p9": "Caring for over a hundred children is not an easy task, but Phuc doesn't intend to stop here. He declared he will continue “this work until my last breath of life, and I encourage my children to continue helping other underprivileged people”."
