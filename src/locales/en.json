    "q1": {
      "question": "Who can participate in Spiritual Adoption?",
      "answer": "Anyone: laypeople, religious, children, youth, and adults. All it takes is the desire to save a life through prayer."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Can I adopt more than one child at a time?",
      "answer": "The rule recommends adopting one child at a time, so that the commitment is lived with fidelity during the 9 months."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What should I do if I forget to pray one day?",
      "answer": "It is not a sin, but prolonged forgetting interrupts the Adoption. If you forget one day, continue normally the next day. If you forget for a long time, the commitment should be restarted."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How to choose the child's name?",
      "answer": "You don't need to choose a name, as God already knows them. But if you wish, you can give a symbolic name to facilitate your prayer."
