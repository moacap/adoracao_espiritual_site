    "q3": {
      "question": "What should I do if I forget to pray one day?",
      "answer": "It is not a sin, but prolonged forgetting interrupts the Adoption. If you forget one day, continue normally the next day. If you forget for a long time, the commitment should be restarted."

    "q4": {
      "question": "How to choose the child's name?",
      "answer": "You don't need to choose a name, as God already knows them. But if you wish, you can give a symbolic name to facilitate your prayer."
